# Introduction

There is, however, a burgeoning new trend in higher education, and that is the integration of open source educational resources in the classroom. Professors and instructors are turning away from printed textbooks and toward electronic platforms that can host educational information. Since we live in such a technologic society it makes sense that our classrooms integrate innovation. Open educational resources can be more cost-efficient than their printed counterparts, lowering textbook costs for students. They can also be easily updated and manipulated, with changes occurring in a matter of minutes rather than the time it takes to publish a new edition of a printed resource.

Our Advanced Web Development course required the use of a textbook entitled Web 2.0 by Amy Shuen, which was published ten years ago in 2008. As such, our team was tasked with discovering a new alternative to this outdated book, one that met certain technology and business requirements. BookStack, an electronic open source platform, is my proposed option, and the following sections will expand upon its potential viability and value to this course.
